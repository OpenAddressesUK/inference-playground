# This script calculates how many addresses can be inferred from Open Addresses
# UK's dataset by using simple, house number-based inference.
#
# The algorithm we plan to use for inference generates all possible house
# numbers for knowns streets, based on the following assumptions:
# a) If two addresses belong to the same street and postcode, all other
#    house numbers betweeen those addresses' house numbers belong to the same
#    street and postcode, too.
# b) If all known house numbers in the same street and postcode are even, it is
#    likely that most of the missing even numbers between the min and max of the
#    known house numbers exist, too.
# c) As for (b) but for odd numbers.
# d) If both odd and even numbers can be found within the known house numbers in
#    the same street and postcode, it is likely that most of the missing numbers
#    between the the min and max of the known house numbers exist, too.
#
# To run this script, unzip the data only, split by postcode sector version
# of Open Addresses UK's data in the 'data' folder.
